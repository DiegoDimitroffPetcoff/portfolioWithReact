       I am Diego, I was born in Argentina, in a province called
      Chaco. In the year 2021 I started studying web programming and English! In
      such a way that everything you will see on this website will be knowledge
      that I acquired approximately one year of hard work and effort!. I am very
      enthusiastic about the world of programming since every day I learn
      something new. Although my experience is still very short, I hope you
      enjoy browsing my website, you will be able to observe the projects in
      which I was involved, from the newest to the oldest! Enjoy the trip!.
