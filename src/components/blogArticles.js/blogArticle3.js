        This last month I found myself working very hard on the latest edition
        of the No Country internship. We started to carry out this super
        interesting project! An application aimed at IT students who want to
        learn and teach!! In this case I make a sample of the work done from the
        back with Postman. You can see the responses that the API offers. Check
        a short video about this project I shared here a little of the work of
        the last month. In this case, the videos are in their Spanish version
        and I show the features of the API that I was working on:
