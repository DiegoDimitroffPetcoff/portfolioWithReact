        professional growth that I am achieving day by day. In the first place,
        a new certificate obtained thanks to the free teaching of Open Bootcam.
        On the other hand, a new game project where I am working on new skills!
        Developing in ReactJS. fetching external APIS, deploying the project on
        different hosts!. Let me share with all of you somethip about this
        projects!. I deployed the same project in two different free Hosts:
        Render. com & Railway.app.. You can try any of them.. just keep on main
        both are free and therefore could be a litle slow to charge..be patient!
